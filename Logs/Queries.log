I'm sorry, but currently there are no laptops that function as a mobile phone. However, there are mobile phones with powerful capabilities that can perform many of the functions of a laptop. For example, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has a powerful A14 Bionic chip that can handle complex tasks, and it supports 5G for fast internet connectivity. It also has a triple-camera system for high-quality photos and videos. If you need to make calls, you can use the dual SIM with eSIM feature to have both a personal number and a business number on the same iPhone. Please note that the iPhone 12 Pro Max is not compatible with existing micro‑SIM cards.
